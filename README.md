# Music-Player
A simple web-based music player, mainly done as a personal project, reads a JSON file(tracklist.json) to get song information and artwork.
The user can also directly update more songs to their library, via PHP, this function will not work to its full extent with this version of the project as my file that handles uploading calls a script that is currently hardcoded for my system.
Also includes the ability to directly link to a song and has partially working playlist support.
